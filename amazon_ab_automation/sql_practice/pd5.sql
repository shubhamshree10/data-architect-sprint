Understood. The mission is active.

You are being dropped into a critical "Customer Retention" task force. The Head of Prime Video for India needs a "small tweak" to the weekly business review (WBR) report, but the analyst who built it is gone.

**Your Mission:** Modify the legacy query to meet three new, urgent requirements for tomorrow's WBR meeting.

### \#\# ðŸª‚ Parachute Drop \#5: The Amazon Prime Video "Beast"

**The "Battlefield" (The Schema):**

  * **`prime_members`**: `member_id`, `join_date`, `region` ('South', 'North', 'West', 'East'), `subscription_tier` ('Prime', 'Prime Lite')
  * **`video_catalog`**: `video_id`, `title`, `content_type` ('Original', 'Licensed'), `genre`, `primary_language` ('Hindi', 'Tamil', 'Telugu', 'English')
  * **`streaming_logs`**: `log_id`, `member_id`, `video_id`, `session_start_time` (TIMESTAMP), `watch_duration_minutes` (INT), `stream_source` ('FireTV', 'Mobile', 'Web')
  * **`watchlist_events`**: `event_id`, `member_id`, `video_id`, `date_added` (DATE)
  * **`regional_marketing_spend`**: `campaign_id`, `region`, `content_type_targeted` ('Original', 'Licensed', 'All'), `spend_date` (DATE), `cost_inr` (INT)

### \#\# Your "Urgent" Mission (The New Requirements)

The stakeholder just told you:

> "This report 'feels wrong.' 'Completed Watch Hours' is way too low for our South 'Originals,' and I'm hearing our 'Watchlist-to-Stream' conversion is a disaster for our new Tamil and Telugu content. The whole report is a mess. I need a single dashboard for my Monday WBR that shows me what's *really* happening."

You've analyzed the request. The business problems are:

1.  **"Completed Watch Hours" is wrong.** It's pulling *all* watch time. The stakeholder only wants to see watch time for **'Original'** content.
2.  **"Total Marketing Spend" is wrong.** It's pulling *all* spend. It needs to *only* sum spend from campaigns where `content_type_targeted` was **'Original'**.
3.  **"Watchlist-to-Stream" conversion is missing.** You need to add this new metric. The definition is: *(Members who added an 'Original' to their watchlist AND also streamed that *same* 'Original' content) / (Total members who added an 'Original' to their watchlist)*.

You have to find the right places to modify this beast, join in new tables, and alter the core logic without breaking the rest of the report.

Good luck.
