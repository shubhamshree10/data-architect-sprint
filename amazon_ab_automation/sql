### \#\# ðŸª‚ Parachute Drop \#4: The Nightmare Report

**Your Situation:**
You've just been pulled onto the "Customer Retention" task force. You've been given the main query
 that generates the weekly "At-Risk Customer" report. It's a mess. 
 The Head of Retention just gave you three new, non-negotiable requirements that need to be 
 implemented for a meeting tomorrow morning.

**Your Task:**
Modify the legacy query. Do not rewrite it; modify it.

### \#\# The "Battlefield" (The Schema)

  * **`customers`**: `customer_id` (INT), `join_date` (DATE), `segment` (VARCHAR), `region_id` (INT)
  * **`regions`**: `region_id` (INT), `region_name` (VARCHAR), `country` (VARCHAR)
  * **`orders`**: `order_id` (INT), `customer_id` (INT), `order_date` (DATE), `status` (VARCHAR - 'Completed', 'Shipped', 'Cancelled'), `shipping_cost` (DECIMAL)
  * **`order_items`**: `order_item_id` (INT), `order_id` (INT), `product_id` (INT), `quantity` (INT), `price` (DECIMAL)
  * **`products`**: `product_id` (INT), `category` (VARCHAR)
  * **`promotions`**: `promo_id` (INT), `promo_code` (VARCHAR), `discount_percent` (INT)
  * **`order_promotions`**: `order_id` (INT), `promo_id` (INT)

### \#\# Your "Urgent" Mission (The New Requirements)

1.  **Region Fix:** The `WHERE cb.country = 'USA'`
 filter is wrong. It's missing a key market. 
 It needs to be for customers in **'USA' OR 'Canada'**.
2.  **New Risk Flag Logic:** The `at_risk_flag` logic is 
too simple. The business has a new definition: 
A customer is **also** considered 'High\_Risk' 
if their `distinct_categories` (from the `agg_items` CTE) 
**ONLY** contains 'Electronics' AND they have placed **zero 
'Completed' orders** in the last 6 months (i.e., since '2024-06-01').
 This new rule must be added to the `CASE` statement.
3.  **New Data Point:** We need to add the `promo_code` 
they used on their **most recent order** (by `order_date`).
 If they used multiple promos on that one order, just pick one. 
 If they used no promo, it should be NULL.

You have to find the right places to modify this beast, join in new tables, and alter the core logic without breaking the rest of the report.
